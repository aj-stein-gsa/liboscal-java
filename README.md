# liboscal-java

A Java library to support processing OSCAL content.

This open-source, Metaschema Java library offers a programatic means to work with [OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/) models defined by the [Metaschema modeling language](https://github.com/usnistgov/metaschema). This framework also supports programatically creating, modifying, parsing, and writing XML, JSON, and YAML OSCAL instance data. This work is intended to make it easier for Java software developers to incorporate OSCAL-based capabilities into their applications.

This library is based on the [Metaschema Java Tools](https://pages.nist.gov/metaschema-java/) project.

This effort is part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) OSCAL Program.
